# Blind75
I'm not a software engineer.  Can I learn something from the Blind 75 on neetcode.io (which actually look like they are from leetcode.com))

I will continue to add to this repo with time.  I would be nice to reach some of the harder tasks perhaps, although there is little here that is actually super usefull to me.
